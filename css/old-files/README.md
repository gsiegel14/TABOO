# CSS Reorganization

This directory contains a reorganized and streamlined version of the CSS files for the VEXUS project. The goal of this reorganization is to:

1. Minimize code duplication
2. Improve maintainability
3. Enhance performance
4. Provide a more logical structure

## Directory Structure

The CSS files are organized into the following directories:

- **base/**: Contains reset and typography styles that form the foundation of the site's styling.
- **layout/**: Contains grid and layout-related styles.
- **components/**: Contains styles for specific UI components like header, sidebar, forms, etc.
- **responsive/**: Contains responsive design utilities and media queries.

## Main Files

- **main.css**: The main stylesheet that imports all other CSS files in the correct order.

## Component Files

- **header.css**: Styles for the site header and navigation.
- **sidebar.css**: Styles for the sidebar menu.
- **logo.css**: Styles for various logo presentations throughout the site.
- **form.css**: Styles for form elements and controls.
- **fancybox.css**: Enhanced styles for the Fancybox lightbox component.

## Mobile Optimizations

Mobile optimizations have been consolidated into the responsive.css file, which includes:

- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Improved spacing for mobile devices
- Optimized typography for smaller screens
- Performance improvements for mobile devices

## Usage

To use these styles, include the main.css file and fontawesome in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="html5up-phantom/assets/css-new/main.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="html5up-phantom/assets/css/fontawesome-all.min.css" />
```

Note: The fontawesome-all.min.css file needs to be included separately as it's not imported by main.css.

## Migration Notes

This reorganization preserves all functionality from the original CSS files while eliminating redundancy and improving organization. The files have been structured to make future maintenance easier.

Key improvements:
- Consolidated mobile optimizations
- Removed duplicate styles
- Improved organization with a logical file structure
- Enhanced performance through better CSS organization
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing HTML
